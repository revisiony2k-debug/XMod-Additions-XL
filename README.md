Mission statement for the mod: A collection of additions made to give unloved items more use, bolster lackluster aspects, and use unique quirks as inspiration for new features in this Vanilla expansion! Think of it as sprinkling a little zest and flavor over every aspect of the game :D

Project inspired by my original work "XMod Additions" from years ago. The project aims to keep the "kitchen sink" feel that the original project has, while focusing the overall project towards this new goal of "Vanilla+"

Current roadmap plans for long-term version support:
* Forge 1.18.2 (last good version of MC in my own personal opinion)
* NeoForge latest version
* Fabric (very much experimental and will not be a focus but I do intend to keep as much feature parity as possible and still maintain good performance and stability)
