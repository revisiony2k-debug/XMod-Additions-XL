Mission statement for the mod: A collection of additions made to give unloved items more use, bolster lackluster aspects, and use unique quirks as inspiration for new features in this Vanilla expansion! Think of it as sprinkling a little zest and flavor over every aspect of the game :D

Project inspired by my original work "XMod Additions" from years ago. The project aims to keep the "kitchen sink" feel that the original project has, while focusing the overall project towards this new goal of "Vanilla+". Progress will likely happen intermittently as time and inspiration strike. The goal with this mod is to distinctly avoid the idea of "overhauling" the Vanilla experience, and instead wants to add seasoning and flavor to it all. I want to take a look at all the loose ends, disconnected features, and underappreciated or underdeveloped ideas and try to expand upon them, with restraint and care not to make Minecraft into a different game. I want to keep Redstone and add onto it, not replace it with RF/Flux/etc. I want to bolster the inventory system, not replace it with Applied Energistcs 2. I want to give new uses for things that have almost none. I want to add additional utility in some areas I personally feel are lacking in the base game.

In short, I want this to become something that almost feels like a "mini modpack" that keeps Vanilla at the front and center. This mod should hopefulyl feel invisible, slotting all of it's ideas and features comfortably into the base experience without overwriting or undermining a single thing.

Current roadmap plans for long-term version support:
* Forge 1.18.2 (last good version of MC in my own personal opinion)
* NeoForge (latest version within reason)
* Fabric (very much experimental and will not be a focus but I do intend to keep as much feature parity as possible and still maintain good performance and stability)

Please remember to use the appropriate tags for all issues. Some things to keep in mind when submitting:
* For bug reports, please specify what version you are using (release #, modloadar, MC version, etc). Please also specify in as much detail as possible what is happening, so that I can reproduce the issue and track down the source of the bug.
* For reviews & feedback, please be detailed in your criticisms. I want to be able to clearly understand what is working and what is not; what is frustrating and what is enjoyable. Feedback is hard to listen to when one is "just hating on the project".
* For suggestions on new features or ideas, please try to stay "down to earth" so-to-speak. I am trying to take the approach of "seasoning the Vanilla experience", rather than a true overhaul. The new dimension is about as out-there as I intend to get.
